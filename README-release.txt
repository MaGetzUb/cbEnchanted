cbEnchanted README
------------------

cbEnchanted is a remake of CoolBasic beta runtime.
The CBCompiler.exe files in Windows release are modified
in such a way that the old runtime is replaced
with the new, cbEnchanted runtime. The compiler has also
been replaced with a modded compiler that has its function
limit raised to 2000. All the other parts of CBCompiler are
owned by Jukka Lavonen.

All hail CoolBasic! http://www.coolbasic.com
