1) What be this
cbEnchanted is a remake of CoolBasic beta runtime.
cbEnchanted is aiming to be harder, better, faster
and stronger than current CoolBasic runtime and also
one of the main goals is to support Linux, Windows and maybe MAC too.

The project is going to be semi open source offering
most of the code for everyone but limiting access
to top-secret parts of CoolBasic bytecode.

This repository holds code for secret bytecode info so
sharing any parts of the code is strictly forbidden.

2)
Linux:
- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake ..
  * You can optionally call cmake with parameter '-D TEST:bool=true' to tell make to create a test binary
- make

Windows: "insert_guide_here"

3)
Edit code and upload.
